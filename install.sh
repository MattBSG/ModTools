echo Follow the instructions to create an application and bot account. Then enter the accounts USER ID in the following prompt. Make sure it is the CORRECT user id or ModTools will give the wrong invite link!

echo Now we need to get your userid.
echo      Find it by mentioning your self with a backslash before.

echo
echo      You would enter "66516516512568135" without quotes. This will be set as the bot\'s ownerid
echo
echo Please enter YOUR userid:
read ownerid
echo Got it. $ownerid is the user id to be set as bot owner. Moving on.

echo Last but not least, we need to know what you want to use for the command prefix
echo      For example: In !!help !! is the command prefix
