echo      Find it by mentioning your self with a backslash before.
echo      For example: \\@DamFam#1234 will read something like \<@66516516512568135\>
echo
echo      You would enter "66516516512568135" without quotes. This will be set as the bot\'s ownerid

echo Last but not least, we need to know what you want to use for the command prefix
echo      For example: In !!help !! is the command prefix
echo
echo Please enter what you would like for your command prefix \(\"!!\" is the default\):
