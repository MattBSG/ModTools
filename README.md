# This repository is no longer maintained and no longer works (or soon won't)
It has not been migrated to newer versions of discord.py and will not be able to log onto discord because the version of the gateway it uses no longer is available. It only serves as an archive now.

This is a personal fork with light modification with fixes, additions, and changes for ModTools by [SexualRhinoceros](https://github.com/sexualrhinoceros); all rights reserved for content created by them. This repository is not associated with SexualRhinoceros or his communities, and no support will be given by them or me for use of this unofficial repository.
